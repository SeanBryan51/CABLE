# Welcome to the CABLE Land Surface Model documentation

This site is generated from a [GitHub repository][repo]
which consists of documentation in markdown files contained in the `documentation/docs` sub-directory, which are rendered using [mkdocs] and [material]. 

There is also full [API documentation][API], which is automatically generated by [FORD] from the CABLE source code contained in the `src` directory. 

Here is a change!
